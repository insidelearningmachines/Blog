In this repository, you can find the complete python3 code examples used on www.insidelearningmachines.com. Each article on the aforementioned website will have an associated jupyter notebook, with the same name, located here. 

I used anaconda to setup the environment required to develop the code presented here, however you are not limited to this. Each notebook is self-contained, and does not require any additional files to run.
